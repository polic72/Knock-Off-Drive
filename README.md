# Knock-Off-Drive
The HTTP server to Knock-Off Drive, a home-made model of a Google-Drive-like program for personal storage.

This was made as part of a final project for my Network Programming Class in it. Feel free to do anything you want with the code, as the MIT license describes.

Apologies for any unprofessional or messy code; programs with a deadline can't always be the cleanest.
The documentation in particular can get fairly heft, but it should mostly describe everything that's going on.

The main method is in the Knock-Off-Drive/src/Drive/Drive.java file.
